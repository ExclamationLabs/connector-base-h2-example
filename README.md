### Connector Base Framework H2 Database Example Connector

This software is Copyright 2020 Exclamation Labs.  Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

This is a sample connector implementation of the
 [Connector Base Framework](https://github.com/ExclamationLabs/connector-base).
 This project leverages a just-in-time in-memory H2 database to test its IAM operations.
 The purpose of this project is twofold: (1) to provide sample and skeleton code for connector
 developers who are using the Connector Base framework and (2) allow for simple integration
 testing with MidPoint that is not tied to any external customer or implementation and is basically
 standalone.
